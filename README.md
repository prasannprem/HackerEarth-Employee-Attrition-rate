# HackerEarth-Employee-Attrition-rate
Problem statement:
Employees certainly are the most important asset of an organization. They are the ones working behind the scenes to ensure that your business functions seamlessly like a well-oiled machine. Hiring the best fit for an organization and ensuring that they stick with the company are two sides of the same coin. Employee attrition not only may lead to a minor hitch in the system, but it is also a major cost to the organization.
The Human Resources department of your organization is determined to predict the employee attrition rate in advance and put a corrective plan of action in place. As a Machine Learning Specialist, the HR team has requested you to build a sophisticated model that predicts the organizationâ€™s attrition rate.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of various details such as gender and age of the employee, education and relationship status, pay scale, and other factors that may influence the attrition rate.

Additional information:
The following repository contains the jupyter notebook file containing the data processing steps and excel spreadsheet containing the predicted result.
Training and testing dataset have also been uploaded so that you can also try it yourself.
